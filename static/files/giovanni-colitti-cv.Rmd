Selected Research {data-icon=file}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Do Concealed Firearms Decrease Crime? An Analysis Using Active Concealed Firearm License Data in the United States

Used a unique dataset on county-level concealed firearms permits and applied 
two-stage least squares estimation to show that concealed firearms do not decrease crime.

N/A

2018

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.6342/NTU201800993

### Do HEVs Cause More Cyclist & Pedestrian Injuries?

Used logit model & large UK accident-level dataset to show that quieter electric vehicles 
significantly increase pedestrian accidents net of other covariates including speed limit and 
urbanization. Also used Bayesian methods (MCMC) to estimate the posterior distribution and 
check for non-normality in estimates.

N/A

2018

### Effect of Hurricane Morakot on Agricultural Prices in Taiwan

Used a difference-in-differences (DiD) event study model and a large transaction-level dataset 
to quantify the casual effect of Hurricane Morakot on vegetable prices in Taiwan, adding weight 
to the literature that claims weather is oftentimes the most important driver of local agricultural 
prices.

Remote

2022 - Current

- Led the optimization of BigQuery table schemas and pipelines for trillions of rows of data, 
  reducing query costs by over 90%.
- Contributed to the development of a K8s cost model, wrote an API 
  to facilitate the extraction of cost information from the model, and designed a Shiny app for 
  visualization and counterfactual analysis.
- Automated tooling for customer chargebacks and built tools to forecast resource 
  clawbacks, streamlining reporting and planning processes.
- Developed and presented interactive K8s usage reports, enhancing internal customer 
  visibility and efficiency.
- Performed simulations to quantify the impact of new server configs on resource fragmentation and cost.

  
### Fieldin

*Senior Business Intelligence Analyst*

Remote

2020 - 2022

- Developed an app for interactive drag-and-drop creation of visualizations and tables in PowerPoint slides, 
  saving users hours per week as revealed by a user survey.
- Created an algorithm for counting harvest loads by analyzing distance patterns, achieving 90% 
  prediction accuracy.
- Developed an app for interactive mapping of machine data and additional apps for ad-hoc 
  report creation, supporting the customer success team.
- Managed database tables serving as the backend for the apps used to support the customer success team.
- Created and managed a platform for developing and publishing web applications using ShinyProxy.

### Grimmway

Selected Research {data-icon=file}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Do Concealed Firearms Decrease Crime? An Analysis Using Active Concealed Firearm License Data in the United States

Used a unique dataset on county-level concealed firearms permits and applied 
two-stage least squares estimation to show that concealed firearms do not decrease crime.

N/A

2018

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.6342/NTU201800993

### Do HEVs Cause More Cyclist & Pedestrian Injuries?

Used logit model & large UK accident-level dataset to show that quieter electric vehicles 
significantly increase pedestrian accidents net of other covariates including speed limit and 
urbanization. Also used Bayesian methods (MCMC) to estimate the posterior distribution and 
check for non-normality in estimates.

N/A

2018

### Effect of Hurricane Morakot on Agricultural Prices in Taiwan

Used a difference-in-differences (DiD) event study model and a large transaction-level dataset 
to quantify the casual effect of Hurricane Morakot on vegetable prices in Taiwan, adding weight 
to the literature that claims weather is oftentimes the most important driver of local agricultural 
prices.

<p>I am passionate about predictive modeling, linear programming, data visualizations, causal
analysis, and Shiny app development.</p>
<p>Since August 2018, I’ve been working for Grimmway–the largest carrot producer in the world and one of the largest organic vegetable producers.</p>
<p>In my short time at Grimmway, I have…</p>
<ul>
<li>Used the latest machine learning techniques to build prediction models that beat previous methods by 40-50%.</li>
<li>Developed linear programming problems to optimize business processes.
<ul>
<li>For example, I used linear programming to determine the optimal acres to plant for each area to
minimize overall cost while also meeting weekly sales demand (among other constraints).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Built Shiny apps that provide an interactive and accessible portal to all the sophisticated data
science behind the scenes.
<ul>
<li>Some of the apps I built help users visualize yield forecasts, while others allow dynamic
implementation of linear programming problems.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>While my current focus is not policy related, my background is in economics and I have experience
conducting original research.</p>
<p>Some of the projects I spearheaded include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determining the causal relationship between concealed firearms and crime</li>
<li>Comparing the effects of quieter electric vehicles and internal combustion vehicles on pedestrian
collisions</li>
<li>Quantifying the consequences of natural disasters on agricultural markets.</li>
</ul>

the data science community.</p>

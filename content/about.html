<p><img src="/images/tea-shop-mao-kong.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I am passionate about R programming, predictive modeling, causal analysis, linear programming,
data visualizations, and Shiny app development.</p>
<p>While my background is in Economics and policy
analysis, much of my focus nowadays is on machine learning/prediction in an enterprise
context.</p>

I love making new friends in the data science community.</p>

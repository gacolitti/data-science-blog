<p>I am passionate about using unique datasets to answer interesting questions.
More recently, I’ve grown fond of building web apps in R.</p>
<p>My background is in Economics and policy analysis, and I have experience
conducting original research in criminology, transportation safety, and
agriculture.</p>
<p>In August 2018, I began working as a data scientist at a large agricultural
company where my focus was on machine learning, linear programming, and
causal analysis.</p>
<p>I’m now working at a leading AgTech company, building apps and tools
to help scale our rapidly growing business.</p>

I love making new friends in the data science &amp; R communities.</p>

# Introduction

I only discovered [`flexdashboard`](https://github.com/gacolitti/gold-silver-portfolio.git)
after delving semi-deeply into `shiny` and `shinydashboard`. 
For the uninitiated, `flexdashboard` is an R package that utilizes `shiny` to 
create dashboards.
(If you have never heard of `shiny` you can read up on it [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com))

I think what makes `flexdashboard` different from building a regular `shiny` app or `shinydashboard`
is that it is easier and faster to work with--at least in my experience. So
it is probably a better entry point for building dashboards in R than `shinydashboard`.

In this post, I am going to walk you through an example of building your very own `flexdashboard`
from scratch. We will use the `quandl` package to fetch current and historical data on 
gold and silver prices, then display the value of a dynamic number of ounces of each inputed
by the user. 

Before we get started, you might want to clone the 
[Github repo](https://github.com/gacolitti/gold-silver-portfolio) for this project and preview the 
final dashboard [here](https://gacolitti.shinyapps.io/gold-silver-portfolio/).

# Getting Started

You will need to have R and RStudio installed on your machine. Also, make sure you
have `shiny`, `flexdashboard`, `quandl`, `tidyverse`, and `scales`  installed. And because
we use `quandl`, you will need to [sign up](https://www.quandl.com/sign-up-modal?defaultModal=showSignUp) 
for a free account and get an API access token.

The following code installs these packages:

```{r}
install.packages(c('shiny', 'flexdashboard', 'quandl', 'tidyverse', 'scales'))
```

Then, whenever you want to create a new `flexdashboard` file, just click the icon in the top left 
and selecct the `flexdashboard` template. (You might need to restart RStudio if you just installed
`flexdashboard`)

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/images/add-file-rstudio.jpg')
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/images/select-flexdashboard-template.jpg')
```

# YAML

The top of the newly opened `.Rmd` file includes information on how to build the app. You can
set the `title` to anything you like, of course. The `runtime` option is set to `shiny` but there
are other options, such as `shiny_prerendered`, that I won't go into. Lastly, the `output` is
where we tell the machine we want a `flex_dashboard` with rows (instead of columns) and we want
rows to fill the screen (instead of scroll). 
As a bonus, you can add a social media link and source code in the menu. 

After you're finished, it should look like this:

```{r}
---
title: "Gold & Silver Portfolio"
runtime: shiny
output: 
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    orientation: rows
    vertical_layout: fill
    social: menu
    source_code: embed
---
```

# Setup

In the first code chunk we load the required packages, enable bookmarking (more on that later), and
set the Quandl API key. You can name this chunk `setup`.

If you plan on sharing your code or tracking it on `github`, 
then you shoudn't store the API token in your code. One workaround is to create a new file called 
`.Renviron` in your home directory on your computer and in the first line type `QUANDL_API_KEY=your_token`, 
where you replace `your_token` with the API token from your own personal Quandl account you 
created. This file is loaded each time you open RStudio and creates enviornmental variables
in your R session that can be referrenced with `Sys.getenv`. In this way, you get easy access
to your API token but do not risk accidently sharing it with unathorized users.

Note also the code that enables bookmarking. This is a cool feature in `shiny` that allows users to store
the state of the dashboard in the URL which can be restored at a later time.

```{r}
library(flexdashboard)
library(shiny)
library(Quandl)
library(scales)
library(tidyverse)

shiny::enableBookmarking(store = 'url')
Quandl.api_key(Sys.getenv('QUANDL_API_KEY'))
```

# Load Data

Next, we load the data from Quandl. The first two lines query the Quandl servers, and the rest of
the code extracts and reshapes. 
Because data only need to be loaded once, this step shouldn't
be repeated each time a graph or other output is re-rendered. To ensure that this step is run
_only_ once during app start-up, we name this chunk `global`. In this tutorial, we focus on
gold and silver, but Quandl has data on stocks and other assests as well.

```{r}
gold <- Quandl("LBMA/GOLD")
silver <- Quandl("LBMA/SILVER")

gold_current <- gold$`USD (AM)`[1]
silver_current <- silver$USD[1]

portfolio <- merge(
  gold,
  silver,
  by = "Date",
  all.x = TRUE,
  sort = FALSE
)
```

# Define Inputs

Now for the meat and potatoes!

To make things simple, all inputs are placed in the sidebar. 
Each row in the dashboard is defined by a level 2 markdown header (------------------) and
each column within a row is defined by the three hashtags at the top (###).
We add a sidebar with `.sidebar` and set the width to 20% with
`data-width=200`. (The total width is 1000, so 200 is 20%)

```
Inputs {.sidebar data-width=200}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 
```
```{r inputs}
numericInput(
  inputId = "gold_oz",
  label = "Gold (ounces)",
  value = 0,
  min = 0
)

numericInput(
  inputId = "silver_oz",
  label = "Silver (ounces)",
  value = 0, 
  min = 0
)

radioButtons(
  inputId = "combine",
  label = "Combine Values in Plot", 
  choices = c("Yes" = TRUE, "No" = FALSE),
  selected = FALSE
)

hr()

bookmarkButton(class = "btn-link")
```

There are three inputs here. The first two are used to define how many ounces of silver and
gold the user has in his portfolio, and the final input is a yes/no radio button to combine
lines in the plot created later.

In the last line, we add a bookmark button that triggers bookmarking. Once
clicked, a modal will pop up with a URL that can be used to restore the current state of the
dashboard.

# Current Portfolio Value

Since we are done with the sidebar, we need to create another row. 

```
Current Value {data-height=100}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The goal is to display the current value of gold and silver (and total value) 
in the portfolio using the `valueBox` function from
`flexdashboard`. To ensure that each value box gets its own column, use the header
syntax again (###) above each new code chunk.

```{r total-value}
renderValueBox({
  valueBox(
    value = dollar(round(input$gold_oz * gold_current + input$silver_oz * silver_current)),
    icon = "fas fa-coins",
    caption = "Total Value"
  )
})
```

```{r gold-value}
renderValueBox({
  valueBox(
    value = dollar(round(input$gold_oz * gold_current)),
    icon = "fas fa-coins",
    caption = "Gold Value"
  )
})
```

```{r silver-value}
renderValueBox({
  valueBox(
    value = dollar(round(input$silver_oz * silver_current)),
    icon = "fas fa-coins",
    caption = "Silver Value"
  )
})
```

The `valueBox` function is wrapped inside the `renderValueBox` function so that the value box
is properly scaled to the size of the browser window. The `value` argument to `valueBox` is the
main content displayed. In this case, the value argument is set to
the number of ounces of gold and silver
inputed by the user multiplied by current prices fetched from Quandl. 

The `dollar` function
comes from the `scales` package and adds the dollar sign formatting. Also, the `icon` argument
specifies an optional icon to be displayed in the value box. If you don't like the one I 
selected, you can find another one [here](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery).

# Portfolio Value Over Time

The value boxes display the current value of your precious metals holdings, but what about
the historical value?

The final row graphs the total value of gold and silver over time with `ggplot`. When the app
first loads, both the `silver_oz` and `gold_oz` inputs are set to 0 and the plot should be
empty. The first line of code inside `renderPlot` ensures nothing is plotted when
both inputs are 0. If either of the inputs are non-zero, a data frame is created with the date
and total value by metal. The data are reshaped long with `gather`.

If the user opts to combine the gold and silver line graphs, we need to collapse sum
the value column by date. If the user does not opt to combine (the default), then the total gold
and silver value over time is plotted separately by setting `color = source`. You can choose the
colors for gold and silver with `scale_color_manual`.

The last bit of code adds a lower limit (no negative values) 
and formatting to the y-axis to make it prettier. I'm a fan
of `theme_minimal()` and use it for all my plots created with `ggplot`. Finally, 
the two arguments passed to 
`theme()` turn off the legend title and increase the text size. Make sure to call

```{r value-over-time}
renderPlot({
  if (input$silver_oz == 0 & input$gold_oz == 0) return()
  portfolio_value <- data.frame(
    "gold" = input$gold_oz * portfolio$`USD (AM)`,
    "silver" = input$silver_oz * portfolio$USD,
    "date" = gold$Date
  ) %>%
    gather(key = "source", value = "value", gold, silver)
  if (input$combine) {
    portfolio_value <- portfolio_value %>% 
      group_by(date) %>% 
      summarise(value = sum(value))
    p <- ggplot(portfolio_value, aes(x = date, y = value))
  } else {
    p <- ggplot(portfolio_value, aes(x = date, y = value, color = source)) +
      scale_color_manual(values = c("gold" = "#f5b342", "silver" = "#C0C0C0"))
  }
  
  p + 
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    scale_y_continuous(
      limits = c(0, NA), 
      name = "Total Value", 
      labels = dollar_format()
    ) +
    scale_x_date(name = "Date") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
      legend.title = element_blank(),
      text = element_text(size = 16)
    ) 
})
```

# Deploy

You can create a free [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) account to deploy 
the dashboard to the wild wild web. After you create an account, install the `rsconnect`
package and click the 
blue publish button (next to the run button) in RStudio and you're done! The free account
does have limits that you can read about at the link above.

# Conclusion

You should now have a fully functioning app to track your gold and silver portfolio. 
Enter in your own gold and silver holdings and restore the state of the dashboard at 
any time by creating a bookmark.

<h2>Why Bayesian?</h2>
<p>Bayesian statistics allows us to incorporate prior information
into our model. That means that if we have a priori information about
parameters in our model (and we usually do), we can actually use that
information!</p>
<p>Okay, but how?</p>
<p>Simple, we just specify prior probability distributions for our model
parameters.</p>
<p>For example, we know that a binary variable for whether a field is organic
should have a negative impact on yield, so we might want to nudge the
coefficient on <code>organic</code>, let’s call it <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, in that direction. One way
to accomplish this is by specifying a normal prior probability distribution on
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> with a mean of -0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.5.</p>
<p>In formula notation, it looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\alpha \sim N(-0.5, 0.5)\]</span></p>
<p>Of course, when building Bayesian models you’ll want to first standardize all
your variables. Usually, this means we subtract each variable by its mean and
divide by its standard deviation.</p>
<p>Interpreting coefficients for variables that have been standardized is more
straightforward (in my opinion). For example, if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> turns out to be
-0.8, this means that <code>organic</code> fields have a 0.8 standard deviation lower yield
than conventional fields, ceteris paribus. Specifying priors on your
coefficients also seems to be somewhat easier for standardized variables,
although some would disagree.</p>
<p>Even if we don’t know the relationship between a variable and the outcome, we
can use <strong>regularizing</strong> priors to reduce <strong>overfitting</strong>. A common regularizing
prior is <span class="math inline">\(N(0, 1)\)</span>. To learn more, visit the Stan developers Github page

I am passionate about predictive modeling, linear programming, data visualizations, causal 
analysis, and Shiny app development.

Since August 2018, I’ve been working for Grimmway–the largest carrot producer in the world and one of the largest organic vegetable producers.

In my short time at Grimmway, I have...

- Used the latest machine learning techniques to build prediction models that beat previous methods by 40-50%.
- Developed linear programming problems to optimize business processes. 
  - For example, I used linear programming to determine the optimal acres to plant for each area to 
    minimize overall cost while also meeting weekly sales demand (among other constraints).
- Built Shiny apps that provide an interactive and accessible portal to all the sophisticated data 
  science behind the scenes. 
  - Some of the apps I built help users visualize yield forecasts, while others allow dynamic 
  implementation of linear programming problems.

While my current focus is not policy related, my background is in economics and I have experience 
conducting original research. 

Some of the projects I spearheaded include:

- Determining the causal relationship between concealed firearms and crime
- Comparing the effects of quieter electric vehicles and internal combustion vehicles on pedestrian 
  collisions
- Quantifying the consequences of natural disasters on agricultural markets.

the data science community.

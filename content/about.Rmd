I am passionate about using unique datasets to answer interesting questions. 

My background is in
Economics and policy analysis, and I have experience conducting original research in criminology,
transportion safety, and agriculture.

Since August 2018, I have been working as a data scientist at a large agricultural company where
my focus is on machine learning, linear programming, and causal analysis.

I am passionate about using unique datasets to answer interesting questions. 
More recently, I've grown fond of building web apps in R.

My background is in Economics and policy analysis, and I have experience
conducting original research in criminology, transportation safety, and
agriculture.

In August 2018, I began working as a data scientist at a large agricultural 
company where my focus was on machine learning, linear programming, and 
causal analysis. 

I'm now working at a leading AgTech company, building apps and tools 
to help scale our rapidly growing business.

I love making new friends in the data science & R communities.
